Locmotion Developement Doxygen Requirements

In order to ensure that current and future UPennalizers members can
read and understand the new locmotion code, we are requireing that 
ALL code be documented using doxygen so that documentation can be
auto-generated. This will help keep code clear, organize, and understandable.

In order to help facilitate this, you will find doxygen C++ templates included
in the DoxygenTemplates directory. Each text file contatins the formatted comment blocks that
you may copy and paste into your code. BUT YOU MUST UPDATE THESE TO REFLECT 
THE ACTUAL CODE THAT WAS WRITTEN/CHANGED.

If you would like to read through the doxygen documentation you can find that here:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html

All code that requests to be merged into the master git branch MUST be completely
commented. We will check for adherence to this. Feel free to get more advanced if you
would like, but at a minimum, we expect ALL files, classes, class members, and funcitons
to be properly documented.

Please note that you do not have to worry about actually generating the documentation,
just that all the code you write is properly documented.
